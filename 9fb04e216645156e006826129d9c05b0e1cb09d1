      "message": "This is wrong. If CorelDraw really can save a text box with zero dimensions, then that case should be handled the same way as the if branch above (so the current transformation is applied properly, not just its translation component; and possible group transformation is applied too).\n\nBtw, this still produces a text box with zero dimensions, so applications may decide to not show it... Are you sure this really is the problem? As opposed to, say, a parsing error earlier? Maybe the dimensions are represented in a way libcdr doesn\u0027t expect, because we haven\u0027t encountered it before...",
