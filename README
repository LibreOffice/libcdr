libcdr is a library and a set of tools for reading and converting binary files
produced by Corel DRAW.

libcdr currently supports just CDR files from V7 to X3 and the following
features:

- pages and page sizes
- shapes, lines, Bezier curves, bitmaps
- flat color fills, both RGB, CMYK, HLS and HSB
- different kinds of strokes including dashed strokes

Above that libcdr provides a public API for rendering preview of pages for
applications that have no notion of pages themselves.

libcdr requires boost, icu, lcms2, libwpd, libwpg and zlib to build.
Most up to date code is available from Git repository at libreoffice.org
